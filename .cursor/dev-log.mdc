# Dev Log Guidelines

## Purpose

Automatically log every operation performed at the user's request to maintain a development history.

## Log File Location

- **Directory**: `ai-dev/dev-logs/`
- **Filename**: Use the current date in `YYYY-MM-DD.md` format (e.g., `2025-12-19.md`)

## When to Log

After completing any operation requested by the user, append a log entry to the daily log file.

## File Creation

If no log file exists for the current day:

1. Create a new file with the date-based filename
2. Add a header: `# Dev Log - YYYY-MM-DD`
3. Add a blank line after the header

## Log Entry Format

Use a numbered list with timestamps in 24-hour format in Seoul, South Korea time:

```markdown
# Dev Log - 2025-12-19

1. [14:30] Implemented user authentication flow in login component
2. [15:45] Fixed responsive layout issue in header navigation
3. [16:20] Added dark mode toggle functionality
```

## Entry Guidelines

- Keep entries concise and action-focused
- Start with a verb (Implemented, Fixed, Added, Updated, Removed, Refactored, etc.)
- Describe what was done, not how
- Include the affected component, file, or feature when relevant
- One entry per distinct operation or task

## Examples

Good entries:

- `[10:15] Added dark mode toggle to navigation header`
- `[11:30] Fixed TypeScript error in ArticleList component`
- `[14:00] Refactored API utilities for better error handling`
- `[16:45] Updated Tailwind config for custom color palette`

Avoid:

- Overly detailed technical descriptions
- Multiple operations in a single entry
- Vague entries like "Fixed bug" or "Updated code"
